# MotAli
Alignment of motifs to detect their similarity and co-occurrence

Input data

Two motifs, Fasta files to recognize these two motifs, the threshold of the expected recognition rate for both motifs, tables "Threshols vs. Expected Recognition Rate" computed prelimimary with the whole genome file of gene promoters. 
Each motif is either (a) the position frequency matrix required to compute position weight matrix (PWM model of motif), or (b) SiteGA model of motif, the list of locally positioned dinucleotides with their weights.
